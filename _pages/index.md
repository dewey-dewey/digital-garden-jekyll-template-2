# hi all

this page is a collection of my thoughts on a variety of topics, including, but not limited to: relationships, american sign language, radios, global warming, bikes, coffee, political theory, low-tech solutions, nature, learning How To Use A Computer, musics of all types, the internet, and so on and so forth. within this collection, i'll also be looking for threads that tie different concepts together. some folks call this type of thing a digital garden.

an important note, however: i am *not* an expert in any of this! any document found here should be treated as living, and representative of where i'm currently at. if you disagree, please get in [touch](/about)! hopefully at least one of us will learn something. i'll do my best to cite my sources, but because this is mostly for my own benefit, i won't be super strict. please do not try to cite *me* as a source on anything.
