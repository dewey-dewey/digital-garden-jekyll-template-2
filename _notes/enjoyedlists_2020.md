title: things i enjoyed in 2020

### things that brought me joy

happy solstice, and welcome to a collection of lists of things i enjoyed this year. not all of them were created or released this year, but they are all things that i enjoyed in 2020. some things i explain a bit, maybe throw a blurb or a riyl at ya, some i don't. it's *my* newsletter! 

                                ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

in any case,  these are all things that i would enjoy talking to you about! this is also a solicitation for recommendations! what did you enjoy this year? the next 1000+ words should give you a decent idea of what i've been into, but, despite this being *my* newsletter, i want to hear from you too.

##### **** nothing on these lists is in any order, nor does a lack of inclusion mean i didn't enjoy something (though it's definitely possible). ****

### *experiences*
* three and a half months of not having to do wage labor! did not realize how much further i could have been radicalized against wage labor. despite a pandemic raging, i had time and energy to connect and build relationships with other people in my communities that were founded on care and solidarity. 
* getting married!! kat is a wonderful person, and i thank ian siporin everyday for reblogging her selfies into my life.
* having a desk for the first time in a decade! i like having drawers, what can i say??
* moving to a place that feels like a home! this place rules. we live with the presence of a woman who lived here for 90 years, the kitchen walls are lime green, and we're on the top floor.
* watching kat continually create! i am constantly wowed by the way her brain works, and how dedicated and skilled she is. truly a wonderous human being. (you can check out her stuff and commission some treats at her new [website](https://butterbirdbakery.com)!!
* seeing this video of petunia napping:
